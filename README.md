# Digitalent Frontend Case

Clone repo and run "yarn" to install dependencies & "yarn start" to run project on localhost:3000

This is a CRUD project with mocked backend data using React Context API and Hooks to manage global state. Filter and search functionality is also included in the app. 

Third party packages include:
- React Router Dom
- React Bootstrap
- React Bootstrap Icons
- React UUID
- React Hook Form

Happy hacking! 

Cheers, 
Martin
